It is good.<br>
SkyGen is a map generator I wrote in Python.
You can see how it functions <a href="http://skygen.herokuapp.com">here</a><br>
The server for webapp is a free one so I strongly recommend these parameters:<br>
Biome type: random<br>
Rivers number: 20<br>
Structures number: 20<br>
Chunks number: 4<br>
Minimal refactor height: 20<br>
Maximal refactor height: 255<br>
Show names on map: unchecked<br>
It should work just fine with them, other may cause an application error due to process timeout<br>
Currently name seed database is too large for server to generate names, that is not a problem
in desktop version.
# Terrain
Terrain elevation generation works using fractal noise composed of OpenSimplex noisemaps<br>
OpenSimplex noise is alternate version of Perlin's Simplex Noise algorithm with
no patent rights on it. To generate fractal noise I add diminished noisemaps to the original one with
reduced weights. Choosing proper parameters for scale of size and weights reduction can be crucial to the final result.
After that we end up with 2-dimensional array of integers meaning elevation of a point in cartesian coordinates. (which are indices)
# Rivers
Rivers are generated simply by choosing random point above certain elevation, then selecting
one of adjacent ones with lowest elevation, and so on until we get to water level or exceed river length limit.
# Structures
For now they're hardcoded but I will add procedurally generated ones in the future.
# Names
Using simple Markov's chain-based algorithm and text file with approximately 10000 fantasy city names as a seed
I procedurally generate random names for structures. Shortly probabilities are generated for each letter of being succesor to each letter. Then based on that probability the letters are chosen (randomly but with probability).
# Clouds
Same as terrain but do not appear above certain elevation.
# Rendering
For rendering I chose PyGame, so you'll need that if you want to try SkyGen on your computer.
# Other Requirements
I used scipy for uniform distribution of structures positions. Also OpenSimplex will be necessary for generating terrain, clouds and refactoring terrain (blending biome rectangles together to make seamless map).
